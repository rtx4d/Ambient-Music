This app allows you to play a curated stream of ambient music in the background without any fuss just like you can on iOS! The idea is to have a "set and forget" music player. You hit play, and it handles the rest, providing a seamless stream of ambient tunes. No complex UI or no creating playlists.

## Features (Experimental)
